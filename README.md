# Hi there üññ

This is suposed to be my Github profile but instead is a playground I
have been using to create a minimalistic blogging system and write posts
about it ‚ôªÔ∏è

# In this repo

The following sites are managed by this repo

## A blog

The Blog index is

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and deployed as [Github
Page](https://pages.github.com/).

## My personal Github Profile

The `Readme.md` of this repo is deployed as [Github
Profile](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/about-your-profile)
and the `html` version of this page is generated with
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and deployed as [Github
